[AUTHOR_WARNING]ciaaooaoaoaoaoaoa
CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:60 (target_link_libraries):
  Policy CMP0023 is not set: Plain and keyword target_link_libraries
  signatures cannot be mixed.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0023" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The plain signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "drawPointMovingTest".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a
  target should be either all-keyword or all-plain.

  The uses of the plain signature are here:

   * CMakeLists.txt:49 (target_link_libraries)

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
